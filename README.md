# Image2pix
**A simple script I made for my profile picture in Github.**

It is basically an **Average Pooling Square Filter of *Pxel\*Pxel* dimensions without filter superposition**.

It works with any image that **OpenCV** can read.

Just fill the corresponding variables for **Image directory:** `image_path` and **Filter side size:** `Pxel`.

If you want to save the transformed image just set **save** to *1* and run the save script that automatically saves the new image to the old image directory.
